    <description>
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.12.0-beta1 (Feb 28, 2019)

Please see [the announcement post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-terraform-0-1-2-beta1) for details on how to use this release.

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* backend/s3: `workspace_key_prefix` can no longer be defined with leading or trailing slashes. Users should verify the state paths in s3 if they need to change this in case there are extra slashes in the keys ([#20432](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20432))
* config: `path.module` and `path.root` now return paths with forward slashes on all operating systems, including Windows. This avoids the need to write constructed paths differently for Windows vs. other operating systems, but any existing constructed paths containing backslashes for Windows must now be rewritten to use forward slashes, like `"${path.module}/foo/bar"`. ([#19708](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19708))
* config: `path.module` and `path.root` are now relative to the current working directory, rather than absolute as before. This avoids including a host-specific absolute path prefix on constructed paths, but may show as a diff after upgrade in situations where a constructed path is included in a resource attribute value. ([#19708](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19708))
* tools/terraform-bundle: use the `terraform-bundle` of the same tag as the targeted terraform binary version. This avoids adding complexity to resolve protocol versions across different terraform versions. ([#20030](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20030))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* communicator/ssh: Add SSH certificate authentication ([#18896](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/18896))
* communicator/ssh: Enable ssh keepalive messages for long running commands ([#20437](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/20437))
* config: New set-theory functions `sethaselement`, `setunion`, `setintersection`, and `setproduct` for working with set values.
* config: New type conversion functions `tostring`, `tonumber`, `tobool`, `tolist`, `toset`, and `tomap`. Explicit conversions are rarely required but occasionally useful; use these functions only when necessary.
* plugins: Plugin RPC connection is now authenticated ([#19629](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19629))
* backend/azurerm: Support for authenticating using the Azure CLI ([#19465](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19465))
